  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

  +files/alsa-lib-1.0.29-cross-compile.patch:
  add upstream fix for cross-compiling

  The configure script would blindly ignore $CC when cross-compiling.
  Add the upstream commit that deletes that insanity.

*alsa-lib-1.1.0 (25 Nov 2015)

  25 Nov 2015; Joe Konno <joe.konno@intel.com> +alsa-lib-1.1.0.ebuild:
  version bump to 1.1.0

  Bump to version 1.1.0. The cross-compile patch for 1.0.29 does not
  appear to be needed, so not carrying it forward for 1.1.0. Mask all
  architectures until deemed 'stable' by gentoo-sound team.

  TODO: Version 1.1.0 does introduce the DSP Topology API. This is enabled
  by default, though there is a configure flag to disable it. There are
  kernel configuration and ABI version considerations to account for in
  any future "topology" USE flag handlers-- I haven't sufficient expertise
  to "do it right" at this time, or I would do so.

  Rudimentary bench-testing performed on amd64 architecture.
